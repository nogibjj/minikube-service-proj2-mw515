# A music recommendation service using Rust Actix with Spotify Developer API (deployed with minikube)


## Usages
* Choice#1: Obtain a "client id" and a "client secret" from [Spotify developer website](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login), substitute them [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/minikube-service-proj2-mw515/blob/main/src/main.rs#L65), and run `make run` to make it deployed to localhost 

* Choice#2: Run `make run-pulled-image` to pull a ready docker image and launch it (make sure you have Docker installed properly and have it started)

* either way you should be able to find the website working: http://localhost:8080/possible_genres, then get recommendations from http://localhost:8080/[genre] with any genre you recognized from the [list](https://github.com/nogibjj/minikube-service-proj2-mw515/blob/main/README.md#appendix-possible-genres-from-spotify-api-as-of-feb-20-2023) (e.g. http://localhost:8080/work-out)

## Steps and instructions
### 1. Start with a rust cli [program](https://github.com/nogibjj/music-reco-rust-cli-with-spotify-api/tree/main).  
* 1. Develop and run the program locally
```bash
make format-check
make lint
make run
make build-release
```

### 2. To containerize your app and launch a docker container. See [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/create-docker-images-docker-hub)

#### 2.1 To push an image to DockerHub, you could follow these steps:
* `docker login` and enter your docker "user_name" and "user_secret" as prompted
* `docker build -t [NAME OF YOUR APP] .`
  * You could just run `make build` for this program
  * Build an image out of the Dockerfile:
  * `docker tag [NAME OF YOUR APP]:latest [YOUR DOCKER USER NAME]/[NAME OF YOUR APP]:latest`
  * `docker push [YOUR DOCKER USER NAME]/[NAME OF YOUR APP]:latest`
    
#### 2.2 Build and run your own docker container
  * run `make build`
  * run `make run-docker`

### 3. Deploy to a minikube cluster with minikube ctl (command line tool) 
  * install minikube ctl. See [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
  * start minikube service:
    * `minikube start`
    * make an alias
      * `alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"`
    * download the appropriate version of kubectl and access your minikube cluster
      * `kubectl get po -A` (which runs `minikube kubectl -- get po -A`)
    * deploy applications
      * make sure you have pushed your docker image to DockerHub (find instructions [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/create-docker-images-docker-hub))
      * create a deployment and expose it on port 8080 
        * `kubectl create deployment [NAME OF YOUR APP] --image=registry.hub.docker.com/mianwu/musicreco:latest`
        * `kubectl expose deployment [NAME OF YOUR APP] --type=NodePort --port=8080`
      * Get the deployment information
        * `kubectl get services [NAME OF YOUR APP]`
      * Let minikube launch a web browser (the terminal needs to be open to run it)
        * `minikube service [NAME OF YOUR APP]`
      * You could also use kubectl to forward the port from 8080 to local 7080
        * `kubectl port-forward service/[NAME OF YOUR APP] 7080:8080`

## Note
If you directly run the codes from this Codespaces, it could not work as I failed to install Docker properly in it.

I developed the app on both AWS Cloud9 and Terminal on MAC with an Intel chip, with Docker, Rust and minikube set up correctly.
